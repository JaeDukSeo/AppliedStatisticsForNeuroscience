\maketitle

You'll need these instructions if, when following the
installation instructions in
\texttt{install.pdf},
you get an error after running the command \texttt{conda create}
that says something about a \texttt{PaddingError}
or that references the package \texttt{qt}.

Begin by closing out your terminal
and any instances of Jupyter that you have running.
Then, uninstall Anaconda,
using the normal method you use to uninstall programs.
Next, re-install Anaconda.
You may be asked to restart your computer at this point.

Lastly, open a terminal and 
run the command \texttt{conda upgrade conda}.
Say \texttt{y}es to any prompts.

Now, you should be ready to jump into the regular
installation instructions at the point where the error hit last time,
the \texttt{conda create} command.

Let me know if this doesn't work for you.
