This is especially important for first-time coders, as it will help you learn the proper notation. You should complete all the exercises in the handout, but you only need to hand in the ones listed below. \n",

If you need to brush up on the terminology or mathematics of distributions please refer to the additional materials section of this week’s assignments.
