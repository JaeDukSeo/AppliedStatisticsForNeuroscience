# Applied Statistics For Neuroscience

This repository contains materials for the UC Berkeley course Neuroscience 299, *Applied Statistics for Neuroscientists*, originally written for Spring 2017.

Materials are organized into sections that correspond to weeks of the semester. These folders contain Jupyter notebooks that serve as tutorial material and labs for the course. Tutorials should be completed before labs.

Currently, the student versions are broken while the solution versions are being majorly overhauled in preparation for the Spring 2018 version of the course.
