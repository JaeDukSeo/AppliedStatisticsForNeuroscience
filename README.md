# Applied Statistics For Neuroscience

This repository contains materials for the UC Berkeley course Neuroscience 299, *Applied Statistics for Neuroscientists*, from Spring 2017.

Materials are organized into weeks, and each week contains one or more lab folders. These folders contain one or more JuPyter notebooks that serve as the labs for the course -- interactive mixtures of coding exercises, free response questions, and didactic material. More information on the structure of these folders can be found in the `example problem set/` folder.

Open issues comprise labs that need to be converted from the old format, bugs and issues with converted labs, and requests for improvements to the course, like links to outside material.
