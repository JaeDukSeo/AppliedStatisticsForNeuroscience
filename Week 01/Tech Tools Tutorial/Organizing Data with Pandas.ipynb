    "In neuroscience, we often work with complicated datasets. For example, a full \"data point\" from a neuroscience experiment might include several numbers (input stimulus and neural response) along with a host of metadata -- subject ID, brain region, genotype, experiment date, and so on. Trying to manage this with a collection of arrays is an exercise in frustration, and dictionaries hardly improve the situtation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can borrow a tool from other data-heavy sciences: the _data frame_. A data frame is like a matrix, in that it contains information in rows and columns, but it is even more like a table, in that the rows and columns have names. We'll dive deeper into this below.\n",
